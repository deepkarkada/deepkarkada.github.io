# NOTES:
#   - make sure that TOC names match the actual section names
#     for hyperlinks within the post to work correctly.
#   - we may want to automate TOC generation in the future using

## Latent variables

The possible outcomes of an experiment form the sample space. These outcomes are usually represented as a set. Examples of discrete sample spaces include rolls of a die, flipping a coin etc. Example of continuous sample spaces include throwing a dart at a dart board etc. 
In each case, the sample space can be represented as follows:

A subsample of the sample space are known as events. The events and sample spaces in general have certain properties associated with them. The elements of the set or events must be mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive <d-cite key="latentvarcai"></d-cite>.



<!-- This theme supports rendering beautiful math in inline and display modes using [MathJax 3](https://www.mathjax.org/) engine.
You just need to surround your math expression with `$$`, like `$$ E = mc^2 $$`.
If you leave it inside a paragraph, it will produce an inline expression, just like $$ E = mc^2 $$.

To use display mode, again surround your expression with `$$` and place it as a separate paragraph.
Here is an example:

$$
\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)
$$

Note that MathJax 3 is [a major re-write of MathJax](https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/upgrading/whats-new-3.0.html) that brought a significant improvement to the loading and rendering speed, which is now [on par with KaTeX](http://www.intmath.com/cg5/katex-mathjax-comparison.php). -->
